# Compilation

A compilator for langage LEA(created)

LEA langage has been created for the occasion by our teachers, then we had to create a compilator for it. 

## What you need

You'll need differents librairies which are in the lib folder in the project.

## How to execute it

To execute it you just have to execute the main (it is already compiled and executed). 

You'll see the output in data, with graphs.

## Code

You'll find parsor expressions in Parser.grammar in the parser package.

You'll find scanner expression in Scanner.jflex in the scanner package. 

You'll find all the terminals used by the grammar specified in "Parser.grammar" in Terminals.java in the main package.

Then the typage, the Node creation and the environment in all others package.
